# snakeGame

## Project Introduction
This project is based on the 1976 snake game version.

When the game starts, users can choose 4 different levels of difficulty they would like to participate in.

On each level, users will be able to use the “WASD” key to change the “P” character’s direction.

During the game, users will have to find a way to exist in the maze and earn points by eating the coin (“C”) characters. Meanwhile, users will lose the game if they hit the snake (“S”).

## How The Game Works In The Console
Every time the users enter the “WASD” key, the game will render the map file again but with a different position of the “P” character until the users either win or lose the game.

Users will be able to see how many coins they have earned while playing and a summary chart will show up at the end of the game.
